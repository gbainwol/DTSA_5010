Economic Growth Trends: A Clustering Approach
Project Description
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of the economic growth trends of countries around the world, utilizing data from the IMF World Economic Outlook. Through the application of advanced machine learning techniques, including K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, countries are grouped based on similarities in their economic indicators. The project further employs a Random Forest Classifier to validate the robustness of the identified clusters.

Objectives
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and explore the IMF World Economic Outlook data to prepare it for clustering algorithms.

Clustering: Apply K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms to group countries based on their economic growth trends.

Cluster Validation: Utilize a Random Forest Classifier to validate the identified clusters, ensuring their robustness and reliability.

Insights Extraction: Analyze and interpret the clusters to gain insights into the global economic landscape, identifying patterns, and trends that can inform policy and investment decisions.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python, used for implementing clustering algorithms and classifiers.
Key Findings
Identification of distinct clusters of countries with similar economic growth trends, each presenting unique opportunities and challenges.
Validation of clusters with a Random Forest Classifier, achieving perfect accuracy and confirming the reliability of the clustering outcomes.
